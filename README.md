# Video Manipulation with OpenCV
[Super Data Science](https://www.superdatascience.com) - Practical Project #7

The seventh project in the [Super Data Science](https://www.superdatascience.com/) [Python 3 Masterclass](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/python-3-programming-beginner-to-pro-masterclass) is manipulation of video using the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library. In this project, video is captured from the computer's webcam and two different effects are applied. The first effect is to stylize the video similar to the way that a still image was stylized in the [second project](https://github.com/MKEDataGuy/ImageManipulationWithOpenCV). The second effect is to do edge detection using [Canny Edge Detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector). The two modified video streams, as well as the unaltered stream, are displayed until the enter key is pressed.
